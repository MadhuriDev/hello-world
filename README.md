/**
 * This program is a very simple implementation of John H. Conway's famous "Game of Life".
 * In this game, the user sets up a board that contains a grid of cells, where each cell can be 
 * either "living" or "dead".  Once the board is set up and the game is started, it runs itself.
 * The board goes through a sequence of "generations."  In each generation, every cell can
 * change its state from living to dead or vice versa, depending on the number of neighbors
 * that it has.
